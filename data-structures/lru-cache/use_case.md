# LRU Cache Use Cases

LRU Caches are frequently used in various fields, including:

1. **Web Development**: In web development, an LRU Cache can be used for caching web pages or other resources. When the cache is full, the least recently accessed page is discarded.

```python
cache = LRUCache(1000)  # cache with a limit of 1000 pages
cache.put("/home", home_page_content)
# ...
cache.get("/home")
```

2. **Operating Systems**: Operating systems often use LRU Caches for page replacement algorithms, where the least recently used page is replaced when the memory is full.

3. **Database Systems**: In databases, an LRU Cache can be used for caching query results, with the least recently used results being discarded when the cache is full.
