# LRU Cache Implementation

## Problem Description

Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache that has a specified size limit. When the cache is full, the least recently used item should be removed. Your implementation should allow for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of items.

## Solution

The Python solution for this problem is present in `solution.py`. It uses an OrderedDict to ensure that the order of insertion is preserved, while also allowing for efficient access to elements.

## Performance Comparison

Refer to the `performance_comparison.py` script to compare the performance of different implementations of an LRU Cache.

## Use Cases

Check out `use_case.md` for some real-world applications of an LRU Cache.
